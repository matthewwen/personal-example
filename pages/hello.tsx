                Hello, it's me<br />
                I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet<br />
                To go over everything<br />
                They say that time's supposed to heal ya<br />
                But I ain't done much healing<br />

                Hello, can you hear me?<br />
                I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be<br />
                When we were younger and free<br />
                I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet<br />
            </div>
            <div style={{margin: 20}}>
                There's such a difference between us<br />
                And a million miles<br />

            <div style={{margin: 20}}>
                Hello from the other side<br />
                I must've called a thousand times<br />
                To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br />
                But when I call, you never seem to be home<br />

            <div style={{margin: 20}}>
                Hello from the outside<br />
                At least I can say that I've tried<br />
                To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br />
                But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore<br />
            </div>

                Hello, how are you?<br />
                It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry<br />
                I hope that you're well<br />
                Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?<br />
